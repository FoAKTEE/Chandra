# move47 — LLM search for AlphaGo's move 37, managed under Chandra

Mission brief: `progress/prompt/init.md` in the Move47 workspace. Design source:
`ref-code/v0.02` (go-bench: goarena + gotree; see its `PROMPT.md` and `TREE.md`).

## KataGo on GPU

KataGo is only an opponent and an offline judge. Nothing it computes may enter search,
memory or prompts (TREE.md, hard constraint 1).

```bash
scripts/fetch_katago.sh                                  # release + nets, SHA-256 pinned, into engines/ (gitignored)
sbatch scripts/slurm/katago_bench.sbatch                 # thread sweep on one A100
GO_BENCH=<go-bench> sbatch scripts/slurm/engine_check.sbatch   # grade G2 #37 P10 and G4 #78 L11
```

| file | role |
|---|---|
| `engines/katago` | launcher for the v1.18.2 CUDA 12.8 / cuDNN 9.8 release; adds pip nvidia-* libs |
| `engines/models/kata1-tf3-b11c768-s11003M-d5973M-7gres.bin.gz` | strongest confidently-rated kata1 net (2026-10-05): judge, referee |
| `engines/models/g170e-b10c128-…`, `g170-b6c96-…` | small nets the 9x9 tiers lv1–lv8 were calibrated with |
| `engines/configs/analysis-gpu.cfg` | analysis engine on one A100: 2×32 search threads, batch 64 |

Host: GPUs exist only inside Slurm (partition `preempt`: 1 h, preemptible, 2× A100 80GB,
4 schedulable CPUs, so 1 GPU + 2 CPUs per job). Outputs go to `logs/` and `judge/`, never tracked.
